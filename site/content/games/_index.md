      Our belief at Bit Phoenix is that you, the player, shouldn't be forced
      to pay for our ability to exist if you don't want to.  As such, we've
      used several pieces of free and open-source technology to power our
      website and development workflow.  To pay back the open-source community,
      all of our games, our Peace Engine, our website, and anything else we've
      written is completely free to use, free and open-source.

## The Peacenet

**The Peacenet** is our open-source stealth hacking game where you use the *Peacegate OS*, an Ubuntu-based distribution, to enter a dystopian digital society as an undercover government operative.  You're on a mission to find the origin of, and put an end to, a piece of mind-altering malware that's spreading throughout the members of this world.

## What in God's name is that artwork up there?

That's for you to figure out.  We'll give you a hint - it's from our past.  It's of a game we used to work on before we were known as Bit Phoenix.  That should be a pretty good hint.
