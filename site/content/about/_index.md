intro:
  heading: "Who are we?"
  description: "We're a small open-source indie game dev team started by Michael VanOverbeek in 2017 from the ashes of the ShiftOS community.  With a new team, new skills, and a new vision, we set out to accomplish what ShiftOS never could."

  text: "Our logo, known simply as the Bit Phoenix, along with our name, is derived from Greek mythology and represents our history as the ShiftOS development team.  The stylization of bit::phoenix(\"software\"); is meant to represent a C++ function call."
history:
  - heading: "Early roots"
    text: "Our roots go back to late 2014 from the days of the ShiftOS forums.  Originally developed by Australian YouTuber and programmer Philip Adams, ShiftOS was a game where you were thrown into an experimental operating system and your aim was to try to perform various tasks in the OS so you could earn Codepoints which could be exchanged at the Shiftorium for new programs and OS features. The goal was to upgrade the OS to something more modern and to find the secret behind its mysterious developer, DevX."

      Single-origin coffee is coffee grown within a single known
      geographic origin. Sometimes, this is a single farm or a
      specific collection of beans from a single country. The name of
      the coffee is then usually the place it was grown to whatever
      degree available.

    text: >
      Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on
      an understanding of ecosystem services, the study of
      relationships between organisms and their environment. What
      grows where and how it is grown are a matter of choice and
      careful consideration for nature and communities.

      We want to truly empower the communities that bring amazing
      coffee to you. That’s why we reinvest 20% of our profits into
      farms, local businesses and schools everywhere our coffee is
      grown. You can see the communities grow and learn more about
      coffee farming on our blog.
