    Bit Phoenix is a community of both developers and people interested in games and game development.  While we may be tiny, we still have a few general rules in place to help keep things civilized.  If you decide to join the community, it's worth giving these rules a bit of a read.

## General Rule of Thumb

The *general rule of thumb* at Bit Phoenix is similar to the usual sys-admin lecture you get in Linux when you try to use `sudo` for the first time.  Therefore, our rules generally boil down to these three rules of thumb:

1. Respect the privacy of others.
2. Think before you type.
3. With great power comes great responsibility.

We trust that you have at least a basic understanding of these rules of thumb.  Essentially, just use common sense.

## Keeping things clean

In order to help keep things clean and tidy, we ask that all members please follow these guidelines:

 - Don't interrupt an on-going conversation in our Discord with an irrelevant topic.
   - To avoid this, be sure to make use of the `#off-topic` channel.  As the name suggests, that channel is for off-topic posts.
 - When in a voice channel, keep posts related to the voice conversation in the relevant text chat for that voice channel.  This'll make posts seem a little less out-of-context.
 - Avoid using all-caps if at all possible.
 - Do not say the same thing over and over again.
 - Do not excessively @mention others - once is enough. :)
 - Do not "ear-rape" (broadcast excessively loud audio through) the voice channels.
 - Try to keep most bot commands inside the `#bot` channel (including Rythm music requests.)
 - Don't use `#general` excessively for topics for which there are other channels on the server. (For example, most **The Peacenet** discussion should go in `#peacenet`.)
 - Excessive memes are not permitted outside of the `#memes` channel.

### Advertising

This question came up on the Discord about advertising in the server.  "Can I advertise my game here? What are the rules on advertising?"  The general answer is *it depends.*

Advertising in our community is only permitted if:

 - The advertised work in question is, in some way, related to our community (e.x: uses Peace Engine, references our community primarily, etc.), or:
 - you are requesting feedback for your work *without* the intention of leaching members off of our own community.

If you fall into either one of those categories, just be polite and don't be excessive.

## Keeping things civilized

We'd also like to keep things civilized and calm.  In order to do this, we ask that everyone follow these guidelines as well:

 - Excessive swearing is not permitted. (The occasional F-bomb here and there doesn't count as excessive, but if every third word is a swear, there's a problem.)
 - Debate, don't argue.
 - Respect the judgement of staff.  If you have a problem, please discuss it in a civilized manner.
 - Do not personally attack another member on the server or in DMs.
 - Do not post obscene, not-safe-for-work content or content that should only be viewed by those over the age of 18.
 - Do not post racist, sexist, homophobic, heterophobic, or otherwise offensive remarks or content.
 - Do not, under any circumstances, feed a dog chocolate while he wears a tinfoil hat in the microwave. *It's just not cool.*

## Punishment system

In the past, our punishment system went from being point-based (early ShiftOS) to not existing at al and just being arbitrary. However, our current punishment system is as follows and covers all community rules.

 - First offense is a warning, with the user being reminded of this page.
 - Next immediate offense will result in being kicked or muted temporarily.
 - Third immediate offense will be met with a 7-day ban.
 - Final immediate offense will be met with a permanent ban.

*Immediate*, in this case, refers to an offense which occurs within 7 days of the previous offense (if any) or within 7 days of the user's temporary ban being lifted.

**Excessive** offenses will be met with a permanent ban even if it is the first offense.  Excessive referring to offenses such as mass spam, flooding, or just breaking the same rule over and over again with no stop in sight.

**Alt accounts:** Some users use alternate accounts as a backup in case they've lost access to their main account.  Any offense that results in the removal of your main account from the community will affect your known alternate accounts.  This is to prevent users who use alternate accounts as a way to evade a temporary or permanent punishment/ban.  If you attempt to do this, your punishment will **automatically become permanent.**

**Appeals:** If you feel you were banned in error, you may appeal the punishment by emailing `team@bitphoenixsoftware.com`.
