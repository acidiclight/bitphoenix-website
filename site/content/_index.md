    Bit Phoenix Software is a small indie game development team that rose up
    from the ashes of its predecessor, the ShiftOS community.

    Everything we do is open-source.  This website, our games, any utilities we
    write, all of it is open-source.  Here's some of what we do:

      Enter a dystopian digital society as an undercover government operative
      using the Peacegate Operating System.  You're on a mission to find the
      origin of, and hopefully stop, the spreading of a piece of mind-altering
      malware and to find a lost friend buried deep in the system before the
      malware takes over.

      Built to run The Peacenet, Peace Engine is our work-in-progress .NET Core
      3.0 game engine, built with a modern UI system and modular architecture.

  heading: Our philosophy
  text: >-
    Most gamedev teams charge money for their games, the reasoning is obvious.
    You have to keep the lights on somehow. However, we've decided to do our
    best to avoid charging you an arm and a leg to keep us alive.


    This requires the usage of a lot of free and open-source services, so we've
    decided to pay back the open-source community by making our own products and
    services completely free and open-source. We will never make you pay to use
    our software and we'll never introduce ads into our UI. We don't believe in
    microtransactions either. You can choose to pay us if you feel we deserve
    it, but we'll never force you to.
